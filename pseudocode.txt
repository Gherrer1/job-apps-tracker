	check if a sheet named "job-apps-tracker" exists
	if not, create it
	check cell x:y for last_email_scan
	if none, scan all emails, otherwise scan all emails after that date
	parse scanned emails looking for applications_sent, applications_rejected, applications_interested
	update sheet to reflect statuses

Maybe a more reliable mechanism for only fetching brand new job-application emails is to label processed ones with 'processed' label


once signed in:
	check if a sheet named job-apps-tracker exists
	if not, create it
	check cell x:y for last_email_scan
	if none, scan all emails, otherwise scan all emails after that date - scan emails with labels apps-{sent/rejected/interested}
	those labels wont be aptly named on the emails json - we need to know which is which (ex. apps-sent may be called Label_18 in email JSON) - SO:
	for each email, add their label_IDs in a Set
	for each label:
		get label data from Gmail
	map labelID to label_name
	for each email:
		replace email labelIDs with label_name
	for each email:
		if apps-sent:
			add row in sheet
		if apps-rejected:
			find row, if found mark red
		if app-interested:
			find row, if found mark yellow/green
