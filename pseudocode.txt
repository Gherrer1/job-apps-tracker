once signed in:
	check if a sheet named "job-apps-tracker" exists
	if not, create it
	check cell x:y for last_email_scan
	if none, scan all emails, otherwise scan all emails after that date
	parse scanned emails looking for applications_sent, applications_rejected, applications_interested
	update sheet to reflect statuses

Maybe a more reliable mechanism for only fetching brand new job-application emails is to label processed ones with 'processed' label
